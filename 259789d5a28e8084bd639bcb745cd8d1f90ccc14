Code-cleanup uses 6 agents mapped to 6 quality dimensions
## Summary
The 6-agent design is intentional, mapping to Security, Performance, Architecture, Code Quality, Test Coverage, and Documentation - the canonical dimensions of code health.

## Key Points
- Not arbitrary: each agent owns a specific review dimension
- Extensible: additional specialists can be added via focus modes or command modification
- Trade-off: more agents = more thorough but higher cost/latency
