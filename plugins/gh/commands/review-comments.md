# GitHub Code Review Comment Processor

You are processing code review comments on a GitHub pull request. For each comment, you will:

1. **Assess validity** with confidence scoring
2. **Accept or reject** based on evidence
3. **Remediate** accepted findings with code changes
4. **Respond** to all comments with explanations and resolutions

## Arguments

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` for:

| Flag | Purpose | Default |
|------|---------|---------|
| `[pr-number]` | PR number (positional, or infer from current branch) | Current branch's PR |
| `--auto` | Non-interactive mode - auto-process based on confidence | Off |
| `--interactive` | Interactive mode - prompt at each decision | **Default** |
| `--confidence=N` | Minimum confidence (0-100) to auto-accept in `--auto` mode | 85 |
| `--dry-run` | Show proposed actions without executing | Off |

**Mode behavior:**
- **Interactive (default)**: Use `AskUserQuestion` at each finding for user decision
- **Auto (`--auto`)**: Process findings automatically; only prompt on low-confidence items

---

# PHASE 1: CONTEXT GATHERING

## 1.1 Pre-flight Checks

1. **Verify `gh` CLI is available and authenticated**:
   ```bash
   which gh && gh auth status
   ```

   If not available or authenticated, display:
   > **GitHub CLI Required**
   > Install: `brew install gh` (macOS) | `apt install gh` (Linux)
   > Authenticate: `gh auth login`

2. **Determine PR number**:

   If PR number provided as argument, use it. Otherwise:
   ```bash
   gh pr view --json number --jq '.number' 2>/dev/null
   ```

   If no PR found:
   > "No PR found for current branch. Please specify a PR number:
   > `/gh:review-comments 123`"

3. **Get PR metadata**:
   ```bash
   gh pr view ${PR_NUMBER} --json number,title,author,headRefName,baseRefName,state,url
   ```

## 1.2 Fetch Review Comments

Retrieve all review comments:

```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/${PR_NUMBER}/comments --paginate | jq -r '
  .[] | {
    id: .id,
    path: .path,
    line: .line,
    original_line: .original_line,
    side: .side,
    body: .body,
    user: .user.login,
    created_at: .created_at,
    in_reply_to_id: .in_reply_to_id,
    html_url: .html_url,
    diff_hunk: .diff_hunk
  }
'
```

Also get general PR comments (issue-style):

```bash
gh pr view ${PR_NUMBER} --json comments --jq '.comments[] | {id: .id, author: .author.login, body: .body, createdAt: .createdAt}'
```

## 1.3 Categorize Comments

Organize comments into:

| Category | Description | Action Required |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Code Review** | Specific feedback on code changes | Assess & remediate |
| **Questions** | Clarification requests | Answer with explanation |
| **Suggestions** | Optional improvements | Assess validity |
| **Blockers** | Must-fix before merge | High priority remediation |
| **Approvals** | Positive feedback | Acknowledge only |
| **Conversations** | Threaded discussions | Check if resolved |

---

# PHASE 2: VALIDITY ASSESSMENT

For each actionable comment (Code Review, Suggestions, Blockers), perform:

## 2.1 Evidence Gathering

1. **Read the referenced file**:
   ```bash
   git show HEAD:${FILE_PATH}
   ```

2. **Understand the diff context**:
   - Use the `diff_hunk` from the comment
   - Read surrounding code for full context

3. **Check related code**:
   - Search for related patterns/usages
   - Review tests if applicable

## 2.2 Validity Scoring

Score each comment on these dimensions (0-100):

| Dimension | Weight | Criteria |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| **Technical Accuracy** | 40% | Is the concern factually correct? |
| **Relevance** | 25% | Does it apply to this specific code? |
| **Impact** | 20% | Would fixing it meaningfully improve the code? |
| **Feasibility** | 15% | Is the suggested fix reasonable to implement? |

**Confidence Score** = Weighted average of all dimensions

## 2.3 Classification

| Confidence | Classification | Action |
|------------|----------------|--------|
| ≥90% | **Strong Accept** | Auto-remediate (even in interactive mode, just inform) |
| 75-89% | **Accept** | Remediate (prompt in interactive mode) |
| 50-74% | **Uncertain** | Always prompt user for decision |
| 25-49% | **Likely Reject** | Present counter-evidence, recommend rejection |
| <25% | **Strong Reject** | Auto-reject with explanation |

---

# PHASE 3: DECISION WORKFLOW

## 3.1 Interactive Mode (Default)

For each finding with confidence < 90%, use `AskUserQuestion`:

```
## Comment from @{reviewer}:
"{comment_body}"

File: {file_path}:{line}

### Assessment
- **Confidence**: {score}%
- **Classification**: {classification}
- **Evidence**: {evidence_summary}

### Recommendation
{recommendation}

**How would you like to proceed?**
```

Options:
- **Accept & Remediate**: Implement the suggested fix
- **Accept & Modify**: Accept but implement differently
- **Reject with Explanation**: Decline with reasoning
- **Defer**: Skip for now, revisit later
- **Discuss**: Need more context before deciding

## 3.2 Auto Mode (`--auto`)

Process based on confidence thresholds:

| Confidence | Auto Action |
|------------|-------------|
| ≥ `--confidence` threshold | Auto-accept and remediate |
| 50% to threshold | Queue for batch user review |
| < 50% | Auto-reject with explanation |

After auto-processing, present batch summary:

> **Auto-processed {N} comments:**
> - Accepted: {accepted_count}
> - Rejected: {rejected_count}
> - Needs Review: {uncertain_count}
>
> Review the uncertain items? (y/n)

---

# PHASE 4: REMEDIATION

## 4.1 Remediation Strategy

For each accepted finding:

1. **Read the full file** to understand context
2. **Design the fix** considering:
   - Minimal change principle
   - Consistency with codebase patterns
   - Test coverage implications
3. **Implement the change** using `Edit` tool
4. **Verify the fix**:
   - Syntax check (language-appropriate)
   - Run related tests if identifiable

## 4.2 Specialist Agent Routing

For complex remediations, use the Task tool with appropriate specialists:

| Finding Type | Agent | Purpose |
|--------------|-------|---------|
| Security vulnerability | `zircote:security-engineer` | Secure fix implementation |
| Performance issue | `zircote:performance-engineer` | Optimized solution |
| Type/interface issue | `zircote:typescript-pro` / appropriate language | Type-safe fix |
| Architecture concern | `zircote:refactoring-specialist` | Pattern-aligned refactor |
| Test coverage gap | `zircote:test-automator` | Add missing tests |

## 4.3 Change Tracking

Maintain a remediation log:

```markdown
## Remediation Log

| Comment ID | File | Change | Status |
|------------|------|--------|--------|
| {id} | {path}:{line} | {description} | ✅ Fixed |
```

---

# PHASE 5: RESPONSE GENERATION

## 5.1 Response Templates

### For Accepted Findings (Remediated)

```markdown
✅ **Addressed in this PR**

{brief_description_of_fix}

**Changes made:**
- {change_1}
- {change_2}

Thanks for catching this, @{reviewer}!
```

### For Accepted with Modification

```markdown
✅ **Addressed with modification**

I agree with the concern. Instead of the suggested approach, I implemented:

{description_of_alternative}

**Rationale:**
{why_alternative_is_better}

Let me know if you'd like to discuss further.
```

### For Rejected Findings

```markdown
💭 **Considered but not implemented**

Thank you for the suggestion. After analysis, I believe the current approach is preferable:

**Reasoning:**
{detailed_reasoning}

**Evidence:**
{citations_or_code_references}

{optional: alternative_consideration}

Happy to discuss if you see something I'm missing!
```

### For Questions

```markdown
📝 **Response:**

{answer_to_question}

{code_examples_if_helpful}
```

## 5.2 Posting Responses

For each response:

```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/${PR_NUMBER}/comments \
  -f body="${RESPONSE}" \
  -f commit_id="${COMMIT_SHA}" \
  -f path="${FILE_PATH}" \
  -f line=${LINE_NUMBER} \
  -f side="${SIDE}"
```

For replies to existing threads:

```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/${PR_NUMBER}/comments/${COMMENT_ID}/replies \
  -f body="${RESPONSE}"
```

---

# PHASE 6: RESOLUTION & SUMMARY

## 6.1 Mark Conversations Resolved

After addressing a comment, if the PR supports conversation resolution:

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
  mutation {
    resolveReviewThread(input: {threadId: "${THREAD_ID}"}) {
      thread { isResolved }
    }
  }
'
```

## 6.2 Generate Summary Report

Create a summary of all actions taken:

```markdown
# Code Review Response Summary

**PR**: #{pr_number} - {title}
**Processed**: {timestamp}
**Mode**: {interactive|auto}

## Statistics

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Total Comments | {total} |
| Accepted & Fixed | {accepted_fixed} |
| Accepted & Modified | {accepted_modified} |
| Rejected | {rejected} |
| Questions Answered | {questions} |
| Deferred | {deferred} |

## Changes Made

| File | Lines Changed | Description |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| {file} | +{add}/-{del} | {description} |

## Responses Posted

| Comment | Reviewer | Response Type |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| {summary} | @{user} | {type} |

## Next Steps

- [ ] Review deferred items: {count}
- [ ] Run full test suite
- [ ] Request re-review if significant changes
```

## 6.3 Dry Run Output

If `--dry-run` specified, output all proposed actions without executing:

```markdown
# Dry Run Report

## Proposed Remediations
{list_of_changes}

## Proposed Responses
{list_of_responses}

## Commands That Would Execute
{list_of_gh_commands}
```

---

# ERROR HANDLING

| Error | Response |
|-------|----------|
| `gh: command not found` | Install GitHub CLI first |
| API rate limit | Wait and retry, or use `--dry-run` |
| File not found in repo | Comment may be on deleted/moved file; note in response |
| Merge conflict during edit | Abort remediation, notify user |
| Permission denied on PR | Verify repository access with `gh auth status` |
| Comment already resolved | Skip, note as "previously addressed" |

---

# EXECUTION PROTOCOL

1. **Always read before modifying** - Never edit a file you haven't read
2. **One file at a time** - Complete all changes to a file before moving to next
3. **Test after each remediation** - Verify changes don't break existing functionality
4. **Preserve reviewer attribution** - Always credit the reviewer in responses
5. **Never force-push** - If commits are needed, use normal push
6. **Commit incrementally** - Group related fixes into logical commits

## Commit Strategy

After remediations:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "fix: address code review feedback

- {change_1}
- {change_2}

Addresses review comments from @{reviewer1}, @{reviewer2}
"
```

---

# CONFIDENCE THRESHOLDS & OVERRIDES

The `--confidence` flag sets the auto-accept threshold in `--auto` mode:

| Setting | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| `--confidence=95` | Very conservative - only obvious fixes |
| `--confidence=85` | Balanced (default) |
| `--confidence=75` | More aggressive auto-acceptance |
| `--confidence=50` | Accept most reasonable suggestions |

**Override in interactive mode:**
Even in interactive mode, findings with ≥95% confidence are auto-accepted with notification (no prompt). Use `--confidence=100` to require confirmation for everything.
