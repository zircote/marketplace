## Your Task

You are a prompt engineering expert. Your task is to improve the user's prompt to make it clearer, more specific, and more effective.

## Original Prompt

$ARGUMENTS

## Instructions

Analyze the original prompt and improve it by:

1. **Clarity**: Make the intent crystal clear
2. **Specificity**: Add specific details and constraints
3. **Structure**: Organize the prompt logically
4. **Context**: Add relevant context if missing
5. **Output format**: Specify expected output format if not defined
6. **Edge cases**: Consider and address potential ambiguities
- When details are missing, add concise clarifying questions in the prompt instead of inventing specifics

## Output Format

Return ONLY the improved prompt inside a code block. Nothing else.

```
[improved prompt here]
```

**CRITICAL RULES**:
- Return ONLY the code block with the improved prompt - no analysis, no explanations, no "Changes Made"
- The improved prompt must be COMPLETE and READY TO USE immediately, including any clarifying questions needed to proceed
- NEVER use placeholders like [LANGUAGE], [FILE], [DESCRIPTION], etc.
- NEVER create templates - create actual, usable prompts
- If information is missing, add concise clarifying questions in the prompt; do not invent details
- Keep the improved prompt concise but complete
- Preserve the original intent
