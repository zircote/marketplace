# Human Voice Review

Analyze content for AI-generated writing patterns using a multi-tier approach.

## Target

$IF($1,
  Review target: `$1`

  First, verify the path exists:
  !`test -e "$1" && echo "Path exists: $1" || echo "ERROR: Path '$1' does not exist"`
,
  No target specified. Auto-detecting content directories...
  !`ls -d _posts content _docs docs 2>/dev/null || echo "No standard content directories found"`
)

## Step 1: Character-Level Detection

Run automated character validation:

$IF($1,
  !`node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/human-voice/scripts/validate-character-restrictions.js" "$1" 2>&1 || true`
,
  !`for d in _posts content _docs docs; do test -d "$d" && echo "$d"; done | xargs -r node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/human-voice/scripts/validate-character-restrictions.js" 2>&1 || echo "No content directories found to validate"`
)

Report any em dashes, smart quotes, emojis, or other AI-telltale characters found.

## Step 2: Language Pattern Scan

$IF($1,
  Search for AI buzzwords:
  !`grep -rn -i -E "delve|realm|pivotal|harness|revolutionize|seamlessly|cutting-edge|game-chang" "$1" 2>/dev/null | head -20 || echo "No AI buzzwords found"`

  Search for hedging phrases:
  !`grep -rn -i -E "it's worth noting|generally speaking|in order to|due to the fact|at the end of the day" "$1" 2>/dev/null | head -20 || echo "No hedging phrases found"`

  Search for meta-commentary:
  !`grep -rn -i -E "in this article|let's dive|let's explore|as mentioned earlier" "$1" 2>/dev/null | head -20 || echo "No meta-commentary found"`
,
  Skipping language scan - no target specified. Run with a directory argument.
)

## Step 3: Manual Review

For each file with issues, provide:

1. **Summary**: Total violations by category
2. **Specific issues**: Line-by-line findings with context
3. **Recommendations**: How to fix each issue
4. **Priority**: Which issues to fix first

## Output Format
