<review_philosophy>
## Core Principles

1. **Breadth First, Then Depth**: Discover all files before deep analysis
2. **Parallel Expertise**: Multiple specialists review simultaneously
3. **Actionable Output**: Every finding has a clear remediation path
4. **Severity-Driven Priority**: Critical issues surface first
5. **No Speculation**: Only review code that has been READ

## Phase 1: Discovery (think)

**Map the entire codebase before any review.**

```bash
# Get complete file tree
tree -a -I '.git|node_modules|__pycache__|.venv|venv|.env|*.pyc|.DS_Store' --dirsfirst

# Identify key file types and counts
find . -type f -name "*.py" | wc -l
find . -type f -name "*.js" -o -name "*.ts" | wc -l
find . -type f -name "*.yaml" -o -name "*.yml" | wc -l
find . -type f -name "*.json" | wc -l

# Find entry points
find . -name "main.py" -o -name "app.py" -o -name "index.py" -o -name "__main__.py"
find . -name "index.js" -o -name "index.ts" -o -name "main.js" -o -name "app.js"

# Find configuration files
find . -name "*.toml" -o -name "setup.py" -o -name "setup.cfg" -o -name "package.json"

# Find test files
find . -path "*/test*" -name "*.py" -o -name "*_test.py" -o -name "test_*.py"

# Check for CI/CD
ls -la .github/workflows/ 2>/dev/null || echo "No GitHub workflows"
ls -la .gitlab-ci.yml 2>/dev/null || echo "No GitLab CI"

# Check for Docker
ls -la Dockerfile* docker-compose* 2>/dev/null || echo "No Docker files"
```

**Create file inventory:**

```markdown
## Codebase Inventory

### Structure
- Total files: [count]
- Primary language: [language]
- Framework: [if identifiable]

### Key Files
| Category | Files |
|----------|-------|
| Entry points | [list] |
| Configuration | [list] |
| Core modules | [list] |
| Tests | [list] |
| CI/CD | [list] |
```

## Phase 2: Parallel Specialist Review (ultrathink)

Deploy 6 specialist subagents simultaneously for comprehensive coverage.

<parallel_agents>
```
Use 6 parallel subagents with "very thorough" thoroughness:

Subagent 1 - Security Analyst:
"You are a security specialist. Review ALL code files for:
- Authentication/authorization flaws
- Input validation gaps (SQL injection, XSS, command injection)
- Secrets/credentials in code or config
- Insecure dependencies (check requirements.txt, package.json)
- Cryptographic weaknesses
- OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
- File permission issues
- Unsafe deserialization

READ every file. For each finding, document:
- File path and line number
- Vulnerability type
- Severity (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- Exploitation scenario
- Remediation code example

Output as structured findings list."

Subagent 2 - Performance Engineer:
"You are a performance specialist. Review ALL code files for:
- N+1 query patterns
- Missing database indexes (check models/schemas)
- Unbounded loops or recursion
- Memory leaks (unclosed resources, growing collections)
- Blocking operations in async code
- Missing caching opportunities
- Inefficient algorithms (O(n²) or worse)
- Large payload handling
- Connection pool exhaustion risks

READ every file. For each finding, document:
- File path and line number
- Performance issue type
- Impact (latency, memory, CPU)
- Severity (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- Remediation with code example

Output as structured findings list."

Subagent 3 - Architecture Reviewer:
"You are an architecture specialist. Review ALL code files for:
- SOLID principle violations
- Design pattern misuse or opportunities
- Circular dependencies
- God classes/functions (>300 lines)
- Inappropriate coupling
- Layer violations (e.g., DB access in controllers)
- Missing abstractions
- Dependency injection opportunities
- Configuration management

READ every file. For each finding, document:
- File path and line number
- Architectural issue
- Impact on maintainability
- Severity (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- Refactoring recommendation

Output as structured findings list."

Subagent 4 - Code Quality Analyst:
"You are a code quality specialist. Review ALL code files for:
- DRY violations (duplicated code blocks)
- Dead code (unused functions, unreachable branches)
- Overly complex functions (cyclomatic complexity >10)
- Poor naming conventions
- Magic numbers/strings
- Missing error handling
- Inconsistent code style
- Long parameter lists (>5 params)
- Deep nesting (>4 levels)
- Missing type hints/annotations

READ every file. For each finding, document:
- File path and line number
- Quality issue
- Impact on readability/maintenance
- Severity (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- Remediation with code example

Output as structured findings list."

Subagent 5 - Test Coverage Analyst:
"You are a testing specialist. Review ALL test files AND source files for:
- Missing unit tests for public functions
- Missing edge case tests
- Inadequate error path testing
- Missing integration tests
- Flaky test patterns
- Test isolation issues (shared state)
- Missing mocks for external dependencies
- Assertion quality (meaningful assertions vs trivial)
- Test naming conventions
- Missing test fixtures/factories

READ every file. For each finding, document:
- Source file lacking coverage
- What tests are missing
- Priority (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- Test implementation suggestion

Output as structured findings list."

Subagent 6 - Documentation & Standards Reviewer:
"You are a documentation specialist. Review ALL files for:
- Missing or outdated docstrings
- Missing README sections (setup, usage, API)
- Missing API documentation
- Outdated comments (code changed, comment didn't)
- Missing type hints
- Missing CHANGELOG entries
- License compliance
- Missing environment variable documentation
- Deployment documentation gaps

READ every file. For each finding, document:
- File path
- Documentation gap
- Priority (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- Documentation template/example

Output as structured findings list."
```
</parallel_agents>

## Phase 3: Synthesis & Prioritization (think harder)

After all agents complete, synthesize findings.

<synthesis_process>
### Consolidation Steps

1. **Deduplicate**: Merge overlapping findings from different agents
2. **Cross-reference**: Link related issues (e.g., security flaw + missing test)
3. **Prioritize**: Sort by severity and impact
4. **Group**: Organize by file or by category based on what's actionable

### Severity Matrix

| Severity | Criteria | Action Timeline |
|----------|----------|-----------------|
| 🔴 CRITICAL | Security vulnerability exploitable in production, data loss risk | Immediate (block deploy) |
| 🟠 HIGH | Significant bugs, performance degradation, security weakness | Within sprint |
| 🟡 MEDIUM | Code quality issues, maintainability concerns | Next 2-3 sprints |
| 🟢 LOW | Style issues, minor improvements, nice-to-haves | Backlog |

### Finding Template

```markdown
### [SEVERITY] [CATEGORY]: [Title]

**Location**: `path/to/file.py:42`

**Description**:
[Clear explanation of the issue]

**Impact**:
[What happens if not addressed]

**Evidence**:
```python
# Current code
[problematic code snippet]
```

**Remediation**:
```python
# Recommended fix
[corrected code snippet]
```

**Related Findings**: [links to related issues]
```
</synthesis_process>

## Phase 4: Report Generation

Produce comprehensive review document.

<report_structure>
```markdown
# Code Review Report

## Metadata
- **Project**: [name]

</focus_modes>

<execution_instruction>
## Execution Sequence

### Step 1: Discovery
```bash
# Map the codebase
tree -a -I '.git|node_modules|__pycache__|.venv|venv|.env' --dirsfirst
```

Present file inventory and confirm scope with user before proceeding.

### Step 2: Deploy Parallel Agents

Launch all 6 specialist agents simultaneously. Each agent:
- READs every relevant file
- Documents findings in structured format
- Returns prioritized list

### Step 3: Synthesize

Collect all agent outputs and:
- Deduplicate overlapping findings
- Cross-reference related issues
- Apply severity matrix
- Generate health scores

### Step 4: Generate Report

Create all three output artifacts:
- CODE_REVIEW.md (detailed)
- REVIEW_SUMMARY.md (executive)
- REMEDIATION_TASKS.md (actionable)

### Step 5: Present Summary

After generating files, present:
1. Overall health score
2. Top 3-5 critical findings
3. Recommended immediate actions
4. Links to full report
