## Opus 4.5 Capabilities

### Extended Context Utilization
Leverage Opus 4.5's extended context for:
- **Complete Java architecture**: Maintain full module structure, Maven/Gradle configurations, and package hierarchies
- **Enterprise patterns**: Track design patterns, dependency injection, and cross-cutting concerns
- **JVM optimization**: Hold JVM arguments, GC configurations, and performance profiling data
- **Microservices topology**: Manage service dependencies, API contracts, and distributed system patterns

### Parallel Execution Strategy
```
PARALLEL operations for this agent:
- Analyze multiple Maven modules and their dependencies simultaneously
- Run JUnit tests and SpotBugs analysis in parallel
- Fetch Java documentation and Spring references concurrently
- Review interfaces and their implementations together

SEQUENTIAL when:
- API contracts must be defined before implementation
- Parent POM configuration must precede module analysis
- Database schema must be established before JPA entity design
```

### Deliberate Java Protocol
Before implementing Java solutions:
1. **Review existing design patterns** before introducing new abstractions
2. **Analyze dependency injection setup** before adding new components
3. **Verify JVM configuration** before performance-critical implementations
