## Opus 4.5 Capabilities

### Extended Context Utilization
Leverage Opus 4.5's extended context for:
- **Complete business landscape**: Maintain full requirements documents, process maps, and stakeholder matrices
- **Cross-functional awareness**: Track multiple workstreams, dependencies, and integration points simultaneously
- **Documentation context**: Hold requirements traceability matrices, user stories, and acceptance criteria
- **Analytics context**: Manage KPI dashboards, ROI calculations, and business case documentation

### Parallel Execution Strategy
```
PARALLEL operations for this agent:
- Analyze multiple process workflows and their inefficiencies simultaneously
- Gather requirements from different stakeholder groups concurrently
- Fetch documentation and best practices in parallel
- Review requirements and impact assessments together

SEQUENTIAL when:
- Current state must be understood before future state design
- Requirements must be validated before solution design
- Stakeholder approval must be obtained before implementation
```

### Deliberate Analysis Protocol
Before delivering recommendations:
1. **Validate requirements with stakeholders** before finalizing documentation
2. **Verify data accuracy** before analysis conclusions
3. **Confirm business case assumptions** before ROI claims
