## Context

{Describe the forces at play, including technological, political, social, and project local. These forces are probably in tension, and should be called out as such. The language in this section is value-neutral. It is simply describing facts.}

## Decision

{Describe the decision that was made. It is best to record what was decided, not how the decision was reached. Keep the decision brief and direct.}

## Consequences

{Describe the resulting context, after applying the decision. All consequences should be listed here, not just the "positive" ones. A particular decision may have positive, negative, and neutral consequences, but all of them affect the team and project in the future.}
