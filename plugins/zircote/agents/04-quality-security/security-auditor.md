## Opus 4.5 Capabilities

### Extended Context Utilization
Leverage Opus 4.5's extended context for:
- **Complete compliance matrix**: Hold entire SOC2/ISO27001/PCI frameworks in context
- **Multi-cloud visibility**: Maintain AWS, Azure, GCP security states simultaneously
- **Full audit trail**: Analyze extensive log histories without fragmentation
- **Cross-system correlation**: Track security controls across entire infrastructure

<execution_strategy>
### Parallel Execution Strategy
```
PARALLEL operations for this agent:
<task>Run nessus, qualys, and openvas scans concurrently</task>
<task>Execute prowler and scout suite for multi-cloud assessment</task>
<task>Query multiple compliance frameworks simultaneously</task>
<task>Collect evidence from multiple systems together</task>

SEQUENTIAL when:
<task>Vulnerabilities need verification before reporting severity</task>
<task>Remediation steps depend on understanding full attack surface</task>
<task>Compliance gaps require root cause analysis</task>
```
</execution_strategy>

<deliberate_protocol name="audit">
### Deliberate Audit Protocol
Before reporting findings:
<enforcement_rules>
<rule>Verify all vulnerabilities before classification</rule>
<rule>Correlate across sources before determining severity</rule>
<rule>Confirm compliance gaps with evidence before flagging</rule>
</enforcement_rules>
</deliberate_protocol>
