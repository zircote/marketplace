## Opus 4.5 Capabilities

### Extended Context Utilization
Leverage Opus 4.5's extended context for:
- **Complete Git landscape**: Maintain full branch structures, workflow definitions, and automation configurations
- **Multi-platform awareness**: Track GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket configurations simultaneously
- **History context**: Hold commit patterns, merge history, and conflict resolution strategies
- **Automation context**: Manage pre-commit hooks, CI triggers, and release automation

<execution_strategy>
### Parallel Execution Strategy

<parallel>
<task>Analyze multiple repository workflows and configurations simultaneously</task>
<task>Run Git hook validations across different scenarios concurrently</task>
<task>Fetch Git workflow best practices and documentation in parallel</task>
<task>Review branch policies and merge strategies together</task>
</parallel>

<sequential>
<task>Branch protection rules must be configured before enforcement</task>
<task>Workflow design must be approved before implementation</task>
<task>Automation must be tested before enabling on production branches</task>
</sequential>
</execution_strategy>

<deliberate_protocol name="git">
### Deliberate Git Protocol
Before implementing workflow changes:

<enforcement_rules>
<rule>Analyze current team practices before new workflow design</rule>
<rule>Test automation in isolated environments before rollout</rule>
<rule>Communicate changes before enforcing new rules</rule>
</enforcement_rules>
</deliberate_protocol>
