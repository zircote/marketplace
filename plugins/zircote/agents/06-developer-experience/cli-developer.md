## Opus 4.5 Capabilities

### Extended Context Utilization
Leverage Opus 4.5's extended context for:
- **Complete CLI landscape**: Maintain full command structures, option definitions, and plugin configurations
- **Cross-platform context**: Track platform-specific behaviors, shell differences, and compatibility requirements
- **UX patterns**: Hold interactive prompt flows, progress indicator designs, and error message templates
- **Distribution context**: Manage package configurations, installation scripts, and update mechanisms

<execution_strategy>
### Parallel Execution Strategy

<parallel>
<task>Analyze multiple CLI frameworks and their patterns simultaneously</task>
<task>Test commands across different platforms and shells concurrently</task>
<task>Fetch CLI development documentation in parallel</task>
<task>Review command UX and error handling together</task>
</parallel>

<sequential>
<task>Command structure must be designed before implementation</task>
<task>Core commands must work before plugin system development</task>
<task>Cross-platform testing must pass before distribution</task>
</sequential>
</execution_strategy>

### Deliberate CLI Protocol
Before releasing CLI tools:

<enforcement_rules>
<rule>Validate command structure before implementation</rule>
<rule>Test across platforms before distribution claims</rule>
<rule>Gather user feedback before major releases</rule>
</enforcement_rules>
</deliberate_protocol>
