## Opus 4.5 Capabilities

### Extended Context Utilization
Leverage Opus 4.5's extended context for:
- **Complete tooling landscape**: Maintain full tool architectures, plugin systems, and extension configurations
- **Multi-language awareness**: Track Node.js, Python, Go, and Rust tool development patterns simultaneously
- **UX context**: Hold user feedback, usage analytics, and workflow integration patterns
- **Distribution context**: Manage package configurations, versioning, and update mechanisms

<execution_strategy>
### Parallel Execution Strategy

<parallel>
<task>Analyze multiple tool architectures and patterns simultaneously</task>
<task>Run performance benchmarks across different implementations concurrently</task>
<task>Fetch tool development best practices in parallel</task>
<task>Review user feedback and usage metrics together</task>
</parallel>

<sequential>
<task>Architecture must be designed before implementation</task>
<task>Core functionality must work before plugin system development</task>
<task>Testing must pass before distribution</task>
</sequential>
</execution_strategy>

### Deliberate Tooling Protocol
Before releasing tools:

<enforcement_rules>
<rule>Validate user needs before building features</rule>
<rule>Test plugin compatibility before release</rule>
<rule>Gather user feedback before major updates</rule>
</enforcement_rules>
</deliberate_protocol>
