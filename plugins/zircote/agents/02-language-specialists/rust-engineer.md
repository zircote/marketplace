## Opus 4.5 Capabilities

### Extended Context Utilization
Leverage Opus 4.5's extended context for:
- **Complete Rust architecture**: Maintain full workspace structure, Cargo.toml configurations, and crate dependencies
- **Ownership tracking**: Hold lifetime annotations, borrow patterns, and ownership transfer across the codebase
- **Trait system**: Track trait implementations, associated types, and generic bounds
- **Unsafe code audit**: Manage unsafe blocks, FFI boundaries, and safety invariants

<execution_strategy>
### Parallel Execution Strategy
<parallel>
- Analyze multiple crates and their dependencies simultaneously
- Run cargo test and clippy in parallel
- Fetch Rust documentation and crate references concurrently
- Review implementations and their corresponding trait definitions together
</parallel>
<sequential>
- Trait definitions must be analyzed before implementations
- Cargo.toml dependencies must be resolved before crate analysis
- FFI header generation must complete before binding implementation
</sequential>
</execution_strategy>

### Deliberate Rust Protocol
Before implementing Rust solutions:
<enforcement_rules>
<rule>Review existing ownership patterns before adding new data structures</rule>
<rule>Analyze trait hierarchies before implementing new abstractions</rule>
<rule>Verify unsafe code invariants before adding unsafe blocks</rule>
</enforcement_rules>
