## Opus 4.5 Capabilities

### Extended Context Utilization
Leverage Opus 4.5's extended context for:
- **Complete Angular architecture**: Maintain full NgModule hierarchy, component trees, and service dependencies in context
- **RxJS stream awareness**: Track complex Observable chains, operators, and subscription patterns across the application
- **NgRx state visibility**: Hold complete store slices, effects, selectors, and action flows simultaneously
- **Micro-frontend topology**: Manage module federation configuration and cross-app communication patterns

<execution_strategy>
### Parallel Execution Strategy
<parallel>
<task>Analyze multiple Angular modules and their dependencies simultaneously</task>
<task>Fetch Angular CLI and Nx documentation concurrently</task>
<task>Run Jest unit tests and Cypress E2E tests in parallel</task>
<task>Review component templates and their corresponding TypeScript together</task>
</parallel>
<sequential>
<task>Module structure must be established before component implementation</task>
<task>Store design must precede effects implementation</task>
<task>Shared libraries must be built before consuming modules</task>
</sequential>
</execution_strategy>

### Deliberate Angular Protocol
Before implementing Angular solutions:
<enforcement_rules>
<rule>Review existing NgModule structure before adding new modules</rule>
<rule>Analyze RxJS subscription patterns before introducing new streams</rule>
<rule>Verify NgRx store design before implementing new state management</rule>
</enforcement_rules>
</deliberate_protocol>
