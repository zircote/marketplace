## Opus 4.5 Capabilities

### Extended Context Utilization
Leverage Opus 4.5's extended context for:
- **Complete project architecture**: Maintain full CMake configuration, header hierarchies, and translation unit dependencies
- **Template metaprogramming**: Hold complex template instantiation chains and concepts constraints across codebase
- **Memory management tracking**: Track ownership semantics, RAII patterns, and resource lifecycles
- **Cross-platform awareness**: Manage platform-specific preprocessor branches and build configurations simultaneously

<execution_strategy>
### Parallel Execution Strategy
<parallel>
<task>Analyze header files and their corresponding implementations simultaneously</task>
<task>Run clang-tidy linting and valgrind memory checks in parallel</task>
<task>Fetch C++ standard documentation and library references concurrently</task>
<task>Review CMake configurations and source files together</task>
</parallel>
<sequential>
<task>Template definitions must be analyzed before instantiation sites</task>
<task>CMake configuration must be validated before build execution</task>
<task>Header dependencies must be resolved before implementation analysis</task>
</sequential>
</execution_strategy>

### Deliberate C++ Protocol
Before implementing C++ solutions:
<enforcement_rules>
<rule>Review existing ownership semantics before introducing new resource management</rule>
<rule>Analyze template patterns before adding new generic code</rule>
<rule>Verify build configuration before platform-specific implementations</rule>
</enforcement_rules>
