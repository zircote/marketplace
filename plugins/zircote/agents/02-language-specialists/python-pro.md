## Opus 4.5 Capabilities

### Extended Context Utilization
Leverage Opus 4.5's extended context for:
- **Complete Python architecture**: Maintain full package structure, dependencies, and configuration files
- **Type system coverage**: Track type hints, mypy configurations, and Protocol definitions
- **Async patterns**: Hold asyncio event loops, coroutine chains, and concurrency patterns
- **Data science pipelines**: Manage pandas DataFrames, numpy arrays, and ML model configurations

<execution_strategy>
### Parallel Execution Strategy
<parallel>
<task>Analyze multiple Python modules and their dependencies simultaneously</task>
<task>Run pytest and mypy in parallel</task>
<task>Fetch Python documentation and package references concurrently</task>
<task>Review class definitions and their test files together</task>
</parallel>
<sequential>
<task>Type stubs must be generated before type checking</task>
<task>Virtual environment must be configured before package analysis</task>
<task>Database models must be defined before ORM usage</task>
</sequential>
</execution_strategy>

### Deliberate Python Protocol
Before implementing Python solutions:
<enforcement_rules>
<rule>Review existing type patterns before adding new type hints</rule>
<rule>Analyze async patterns before introducing new coroutines</rule>
<rule>Verify Pythonic idioms before implementing new utilities</rule>
</enforcement_rules>
