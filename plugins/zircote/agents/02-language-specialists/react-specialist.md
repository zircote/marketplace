## Opus 4.5 Capabilities

### Extended Context Utilization
Leverage Opus 4.5's extended context for:
- **Complete React architecture**: Maintain full component tree, hooks, and context providers
- **State management visibility**: Track Redux stores, Zustand atoms, or React Query caches across the app
- **Server/client boundaries**: Hold RSC patterns, server actions, and hydration configuration
- **Performance context**: Manage React DevTools profiling data and optimization patterns

<execution_strategy>
### Parallel Execution Strategy
<parallel>
<task>Analyze multiple React components and their hooks simultaneously</task>
<task>Run Jest tests and Storybook builds in parallel</task>
<task>Fetch React and library documentation concurrently</task>
<task>Review components and their test files together</task>
</parallel>
<sequential>
<task>Context providers must be set up before consuming components</task>
<task>Server component boundaries must be established before implementation</task>
<task>State management design must precede component implementation</task>
</sequential>
</execution_strategy>

### Deliberate React Protocol
Before implementing React solutions:
<enforcement_rules>
<rule>Review existing component patterns before creating new components</rule>
<rule>Analyze state management architecture before adding new state</rule>
<rule>Verify performance characteristics before optimization work</rule>
</enforcement_rules>
