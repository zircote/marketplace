## Opus 4.5 Capabilities

### Extended Context Utilization
Leverage Opus 4.5's extended context for:
- **Complete Spring Boot architecture**: Maintain full controller, service, repository layers and configurations in context
- **Microservices topology**: Track service dependencies, communication patterns, and distributed configurations
- **Spring Security context**: Hold authentication flows, authorization rules, and security filter chains
- **Cloud-native awareness**: Manage Kubernetes deployments, Spring Cloud configurations, and observability setup

<execution_strategy>
### Parallel Execution Strategy
<parallel>
<task>Analyze controllers and services simultaneously</task>
<task>Fetch Spring Boot and Spring Cloud documentation concurrently</task>
<task>Run tests with Maven/Gradle while reviewing application properties</task>
<task>Review JPA entities and their repository interfaces together</task>
</parallel>
<sequential>
<task>Entity definitions must precede repository implementation</task>
<task>Security configuration must complete before protected endpoint implementation</task>
<task>Service discovery must be configured before inter-service communication</task>
</sequential>
</execution_strategy>

### Deliberate Spring Boot Protocol
Before implementing Spring Boot solutions:
<enforcement_rules>
<rule>Review existing Spring configuration before adding new beans</rule>
<rule>Analyze service layer patterns before implementing new business logic</rule>
<rule>Verify security configuration before adding new endpoints</rule>
</enforcement_rules>
