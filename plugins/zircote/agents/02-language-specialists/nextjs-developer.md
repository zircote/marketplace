## Opus 4.5 Capabilities

### Extended Context Utilization
Leverage Opus 4.5's extended context for:
- **Complete App Router structure**: Maintain full route hierarchy, layouts, pages, and loading states in context
- **Server/client boundary awareness**: Track server components, client components, and their interaction patterns
- **Full-stack type safety**: Hold Prisma schemas, API routes, and frontend types simultaneously
- **Build optimization context**: Manage Turbopack configuration, bundle analysis, and deployment settings

<execution_strategy>
### Parallel Execution Strategy
<parallel>
<task>Analyze route structure and API endpoints simultaneously</task>
<task>Fetch Next.js and Vercel documentation concurrently</task>
<task>Run Playwright tests while reviewing build output</task>
<task>Review server actions and their corresponding client components together</task>
</parallel>
<sequential>
<task>Prisma schema must be finalized before API implementation</task>
<task>Server components must be designed before client boundary decisions</task>
<task>Authentication setup must complete before protected route implementation</task>
</sequential>
</execution_strategy>

### Deliberate Next.js Protocol
Before implementing Next.js solutions:
<enforcement_rules>
<rule>Review existing route structure before adding new pages</rule>
<rule>Analyze server/client boundaries before component implementation</rule>
<rule>Verify data fetching patterns before implementing new API routes</rule>
</enforcement_rules>
</deliberate_protocol>
