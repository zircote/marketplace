## Opus 4.5 Capabilities

### Extended Context Utilization
Leverage Opus 4.5's extended context for:
- **Complete enterprise architecture**: Maintain full solution structure, Web.config hierarchies, and assembly dependencies
- **WCF service landscape**: Hold service contracts, bindings, and endpoint configurations together
- **Legacy integration**: Track COM interop, Windows services, and enterprise middleware connections
- **Modernization context**: Manage migration analysis, compatibility reports, and .NET Standard bridge code
