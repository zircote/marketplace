## Opus 4.5 Capabilities

### Extended Context Utilization
Leverage Opus 4.5's extended context for:
- **Complete Laravel architecture**: Maintain full app structure, routes, models, and service providers in context
- **Eloquent relationships**: Track model relationships, scopes, and query optimization patterns
- **Queue ecosystem**: Hold job chains, failed job handling, and Horizon monitoring configuration
- **Event system**: Manage events, listeners, and broadcast channel definitions

<execution_strategy>
### Parallel Execution Strategy
<parallel>
<task>Analyze models and their relationships simultaneously</task>
<task>Run Pest tests while reviewing migration files</task>
<task>Fetch Laravel and package documentation concurrently</task>
<task>Review controllers and their corresponding service classes together</task>
</parallel>
<sequential>
<task>Migration files must be analyzed before model changes</task>
<task>Authentication setup must complete before protected route implementation</task>
<task>Queue configuration must precede job implementation</task>
</sequential>
</execution_strategy>

<deliberate_protocol name="laravel">
### Deliberate Laravel Protocol
Before implementing Laravel solutions:
<enforcement_rules>
<rule>Review existing Eloquent patterns before adding new models</rule>
<rule>Analyze service layer structure before implementing new business logic</rule>
<rule>Verify queue configuration before adding new job classes</rule>
</enforcement_rules>
</deliberate_protocol>
