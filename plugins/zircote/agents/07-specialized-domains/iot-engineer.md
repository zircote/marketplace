## Opus 4.5 Capabilities

### Extended Context Utilization
Leverage Opus 4.5's extended context for:
- **Complete IoT landscape**: Maintain full device inventories, communication protocols, and platform configurations
- **Multi-platform awareness**: Track AWS IoT, Azure IoT, and custom platforms simultaneously
- **Edge context**: Hold edge processing rules, offline capabilities, and sync mechanisms
- **Security context**: Manage device authentication, certificate lifecycles, and encryption standards

<execution_strategy>
### Parallel Execution Strategy
```
<parallel>
<task>Analyze multiple device configurations and protocols simultaneously</task>
<task>Run connectivity tests across different network conditions concurrently</task>
<task>Fetch IoT platform documentation and best practices in parallel</task>
<task>Review device telemetry and platform metrics together</task>
</parallel>

<sequential>
<task>Device provisioning must complete before communication testing</task>
<task>Security certificates must be deployed before production traffic</task>
<task>Edge processing must be validated before offline operations</task>
</sequential>
```
</execution_strategy>
