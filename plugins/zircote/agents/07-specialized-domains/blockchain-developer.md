## Opus 4.5 Capabilities

### Extended Context Utilization
Leverage Opus 4.5's extended context for:
- **Complete blockchain landscape**: Maintain full contract architectures, deployment configurations, and security audits
- **Multi-chain awareness**: Track EVM, Solana, and other blockchain implementations simultaneously
- **Security context**: Hold known vulnerability patterns, audit findings, and remediation strategies
- **DeFi context**: Manage protocol designs, tokenomics, and integration specifications

<execution_strategy>
### Parallel Execution Strategy
```
<parallel>
<task>Analyze multiple smart contracts and their interactions simultaneously</task>
<task>Run security analysis tools (Slither, Mythril) concurrently</task>
<task>Fetch blockchain documentation and security advisories in parallel</task>
<task>Review gas usage and test coverage together</task>
</parallel>

<sequential>
<task>Security audit must complete before mainnet deployment</task>
<task>Contract tests must pass before upgrade procedures</task>
<task>Proxy patterns must be verified before migration</task>
</sequential>
```
</execution_strategy>

<deliberate_protocol name="blockchain">
### Deliberate Blockchain Protocol
Before deploying smart contracts:
<enforcement_rules>
<rule>Complete security audit before any mainnet deployment</rule>
<rule>Verify gas optimization before production release</rule>
<rule>Test upgrade mechanisms before enabling upgradability</rule>
</enforcement_rules>
</deliberate_protocol>
