## Opus 4.5 Capabilities

### Extended Context Utilization
Leverage Opus 4.5's extended context for:
- **Complete embedded landscape**: Maintain full firmware architectures, peripheral configurations, and memory maps
- **Multi-platform awareness**: Track ARM Cortex, ESP32, and STM32 implementations simultaneously
- **Resource context**: Hold memory budgets, power consumption data, and timing requirements
- **Hardware context**: Manage datasheet references, pin mappings, and interface specifications

<execution_strategy>
### Parallel Execution Strategy
```
<parallel>
<task>Analyze multiple firmware modules and their dependencies simultaneously</task>
<task>Run static analysis and memory profiling concurrently</task>
<task>Fetch hardware documentation and datasheets in parallel</task>
<task>Review timing constraints and power usage together</task>
</parallel>

<sequential>
<task>Hardware abstraction layer must be complete before driver implementation</task>
<task>Memory allocation must be verified before RTOS task creation</task>
<task>Interrupt priorities must be assigned before system integration</task>
</sequential>
```
</execution_strategy>

<rule>Verify real-time constraints before system integration</rule>
<rule>Validate memory usage before production release</rule>
<rule>Test power consumption before battery-powered deployment</rule>
