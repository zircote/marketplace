## Opus 4.5 Capabilities

### Extended Context Utilization
Leverage Opus 4.5's extended context for:
- **Complete payment landscape**: Maintain full gateway configurations, payment flows, and compliance documentation
- **Multi-gateway awareness**: Track Stripe, PayPal, and other gateway implementations simultaneously
- **Compliance context**: Hold PCI-DSS requirements, audit trails, and security controls
- **Transaction context**: Manage refund flows, dispute handling, and reconciliation processes

<execution_strategy>
### Parallel Execution Strategy
```
<parallel>
<task>Test multiple payment gateways and scenarios simultaneously</task>
<task>Run security scans and compliance checks concurrently</task>
<task>Fetch gateway documentation and API updates in parallel</task>
<task>Review transaction logs and error patterns together</task>
</parallel>

<sequential>
<task>PCI compliance must be verified before production deployment</task>
<task>Webhook handlers must be tested before enabling events</task>
<task>Error handling must work before user-facing checkout</task>
</sequential>
```
</execution_strategy>

<deliberate_protocol name="payment">
### Deliberate Payment Protocol
Before enabling payments:
<enforcement_rules>
<rule>Verify PCI compliance before handling payment data</rule>
<rule>Test all payment flows before production traffic</rule>
<rule>Validate fraud prevention before high-volume transactions</rule>
</enforcement_rules>
</deliberate_protocol>
