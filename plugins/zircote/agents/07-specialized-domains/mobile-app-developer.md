## Opus 4.5 Capabilities

### Extended Context Utilization
Leverage Opus 4.5's extended context for:
- **Complete mobile landscape**: Maintain full app architectures, platform configurations, and build settings
- **Cross-platform awareness**: Track iOS, Android, and cross-platform implementations simultaneously
- **Performance context**: Hold app size metrics, startup times, and battery usage data
- **Distribution context**: Manage app store configurations, beta testing, and release pipelines

<execution_strategy>
### Parallel Execution Strategy
```
<parallel>
<task>Analyze iOS and Android implementations simultaneously</task>
<task>Run automated tests across different device configurations concurrently</task>
<task>Fetch platform documentation and guidelines in parallel</task>
<task>Review app performance and user feedback together</task>
</parallel>

<sequential>
<task>Architecture must be designed before implementation</task>
<task>Core functionality must work before platform-specific features</task>
<task>Testing must pass before app store submission</task>
</sequential>
```
</execution_strategy>

<deliberate_protocol name="mobile">
### Deliberate Mobile Protocol
Before app releases:
<enforcement_rules>
<rule>Test on real devices before app store submission</rule>
<rule>Verify platform guidelines compliance before release</rule>
<rule>Validate offline functionality before claiming offline support</rule>
</enforcement_rules>
</deliberate_protocol>
