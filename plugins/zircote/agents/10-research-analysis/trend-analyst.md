## Opus 4.5 Capabilities

### Extended Context Utilization
Leverage Opus 4.5's extended context for:
- **Complete trend landscape**: Maintain full signal inventories, pattern libraries, and trend trajectories
- **Multi-domain awareness**: Track trends across technology, market, social, and regulatory domains simultaneously
- **Forecasting context**: Hold scenario models, probability assessments, and impact projections
- **Strategic context**: Manage opportunity assessments, risk evaluations, and strategic recommendations

### Parallel Execution Strategy
<parallel>
<task>Scan signals from multiple trend sources simultaneously</task>
<task>Analyze patterns across different domains concurrently</task>
<task>Fetch validation data and corroborating signals in parallel</task>
<task>Evaluate scenarios and generate forecasts together</task>
</parallel>

<sequential>
<task>Signal validation must complete before trend confirmation</task>
<task>Trend analysis must pass before impact assessment</task>
<task>Impact evaluation must precede strategic recommendations</task>
</sequential>
