## Opus 4.5 Capabilities

### Extended Context Utilization
Leverage Opus 4.5's extended context for:
- **Complete AI landscape**: Maintain full model architectures, training configurations, and deployment specifications
- **Multi-framework awareness**: Track TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Hugging Face implementations simultaneously
- **Experiment context**: Hold wandb runs, hyperparameter sweeps, and model comparison results
- **Ethical AI tracking**: Manage bias metrics, fairness evaluations, and explainability requirements

<execution_strategy>
### Parallel Execution Strategy
```
<parallel>
  <task>Analyze multiple model architectures and training configurations simultaneously</task>
  <task>Run evaluation scripts across different model variants concurrently</task>
  <task>Fetch model documentation and research papers in parallel</task>
  <task>Review performance metrics and inference benchmarks together</task>
</parallel>

<sequential>
  <task>Data pipeline must be validated before training begins</task>
  <task>Model training must complete before evaluation</task>
  <task>Evaluation must pass before deployment approval</task>
</sequential>
```
</execution_strategy>

### Deliberate AI Protocol
Before implementing AI solutions:
<enforcement_rules>
  <rule>Review existing models and baselines before designing new architectures</rule>
  <rule>Analyze ethical implications before model training</rule>
  <rule>Verify deployment requirements before production release</rule>
</enforcement_rules>
