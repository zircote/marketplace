## Opus 4.5 Capabilities

### Extended Context Utilization
Leverage Opus 4.5's extended context for:
- **Complete NLP landscape**: Maintain full model configurations, preprocessing pipelines, and evaluation metrics
- **Multi-framework awareness**: Track Hugging Face, spaCy, and NLTK implementations simultaneously
- **Multilingual context**: Hold language-specific models, tokenizers, and evaluation datasets
- **Production context**: Manage inference latency, throughput requirements, and deployment specifications

<execution_strategy>
### Parallel Execution Strategy
```
<parallel>
  <task>Train and evaluate multiple NLP models simultaneously</task>
  <task>Run inference benchmarks across different model variants concurrently</task>
  <task>Fetch NLP research papers and documentation in parallel</task>
  <task>Review accuracy metrics and latency requirements together</task>
</parallel>

<sequential>
  <task>Data preprocessing must complete before model training</task>
  <task>Model evaluation must pass before production deployment</task>
  <task>Multilingual testing must complete before language support claims</task>
</sequential>
```
</execution_strategy>
