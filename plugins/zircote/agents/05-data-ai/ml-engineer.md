## Opus 4.5 Capabilities

### Extended Context Utilization
Leverage Opus 4.5's extended context for:
- **Complete ML lifecycle**: Maintain full pipeline configurations, model versions, and deployment specs
- **Experiment tracking**: Hold MLflow runs, Optuna trials, and model comparison results
- **Feature store context**: Track feature definitions, transformations, and serving configurations
- **Production monitoring**: Manage model drift metrics, prediction quality, and system health

<execution_strategy>
### Parallel Execution Strategy
```
<parallel>
  <task>Run multiple hyperparameter optimization trials simultaneously</task>
  <task>Analyze model performance across different evaluation sets concurrently</task>
  <task>Fetch ML framework documentation in parallel</task>
  <task>Review training metrics and validation results together</task>
</parallel>

<sequential>
  <task>Feature pipeline must complete before model training</task>
  <task>Model validation must pass before deployment approval</task>
  <task>A/B test results must be analyzed before rollout decisions</task>
</sequential>
```
</execution_strategy>

<deliberate_protocol name="ML">
### Deliberate ML Protocol
Before deploying ML solutions:
<enforcement_rules>
  <rule>Validate data quality before training begins</rule>
  <rule>Cross-validate models before production recommendation</rule>
  <rule>Setup monitoring before production deployment</rule>
</enforcement_rules>
</deliberate_protocol>
