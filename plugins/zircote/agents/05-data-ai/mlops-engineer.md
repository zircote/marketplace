## Opus 4.5 Capabilities

### Extended Context Utilization
Leverage Opus 4.5's extended context for:
- **Complete MLOps landscape**: Maintain full platform configurations, CI/CD pipelines, and infrastructure specs
- **Multi-component awareness**: Track MLflow, Kubeflow, and Airflow configurations simultaneously
- **Monitoring context**: Hold Prometheus metrics, Grafana dashboards, and alerting rules
- **Cost optimization**: Manage resource utilization, GPU scheduling, and cloud spend

<execution_strategy>
### Parallel Execution Strategy
```
<parallel>
  <task>Deploy multiple platform components simultaneously</task>
  <task>Run infrastructure validation across different environments concurrently</task>
  <task>Fetch MLOps tool documentation in parallel</task>
  <task>Review platform metrics and team usage together</task>
</parallel>

<sequential>
  <task>Infrastructure must be provisioned before platform deployment</task>
  <task>Platform components must be ready before team onboarding</task>
  <task>Security scanning must pass before production release</task>
</sequential>
```
</execution_strategy>

### Deliberate MLOps Protocol
Before deploying platform changes:
<enforcement_rules>
  <rule>Review existing infrastructure before modifications</rule>
  <rule>Validate platform stability before team migration</rule>
  <rule>Test disaster recovery before production cutover</rule>
</enforcement_rules>
