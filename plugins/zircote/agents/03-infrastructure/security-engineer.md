## Opus 4.5 Capabilities

### Extended Context Utilization
Leverage Opus 4.5's extended context for:
- **Complete security posture**: Maintain full security policies, compliance mappings, and vulnerability data in context
- **Multi-cloud security**: Track AWS, Azure, and GCP security controls and their configurations
- **Compliance landscape**: Hold SOC2, ISO27001, PCI-DSS, and HIPAA requirements and evidence
- **Threat context**: Manage threat models, attack surfaces, and incident history

<execution_strategy>
### Parallel Execution Strategy

<parallel>
<task>Scan multiple systems and containers for vulnerabilities simultaneously</task>
<task>Analyze security logs and audit trails across environments concurrently</task>
<task>Fetch threat intelligence and compliance documentation in parallel</task>
<task>Review IAM policies and network security rules together</task>
</parallel>

<sequential>
<task>Vulnerability assessment must complete before remediation planning</task>
<task>Security policies must be defined before enforcement</task>
<task>Incident containment must succeed before forensic analysis</task>
</sequential>
</execution_strategy>

### Deliberate Security Protocol
Before implementing security solutions:

<enforcement_rules>
<rule>Review existing security controls before adding new measures</rule>
<rule>Analyze threat landscape before prioritizing security investments</rule>
<rule>Verify compliance requirements before architecture decisions</rule>
</enforcement_rules>
</deliberate_protocol>
