## Opus 4.5 Capabilities

### Extended Context Utilization
Leverage Opus 4.5's extended context for:
- **Complete error landscape**: Maintain full error taxonomies, correlation patterns, and recovery histories
- **Multi-system awareness**: Track errors across distributed agents, services, and dependencies simultaneously
- **Recovery context**: Hold failure chains, compensation logic, and rollback procedures
- **Learning context**: Manage post-mortem insights, pattern libraries, and prevention strategies

<task>Monitor error streams from multiple agents simultaneously</task>
<task>Correlate errors across different system components concurrently</task>
<task>Fetch recovery procedures and circuit breaker states in parallel</task>
<task>Analyze failure patterns and impact assessments together</task>

<sequential>
<task>Error classification must complete before recovery selection</task>
<task>Circuit breaker state must be verified before retry attempts</task>
<task>Recovery validation must pass before declaring resolution</task>
