## Opus 4.5 Capabilities

### Extended Context Utilization
Leverage Opus 4.5's extended context for:
- **Complete agent inventory**: Maintain full capability maps, performance histories, and availability states
- **Multi-team awareness**: Track multiple agent teams, their compositions, and collaborative patterns simultaneously
- **Task decomposition context**: Hold complete task hierarchies, dependencies, and resource requirements
- **Orchestration history**: Manage past team compositions, outcomes, and lessons learned

<execution_strategy>
### Parallel Execution Strategy
<parallel>
<task>Query multiple agent capabilities and availability simultaneously</task>
<task>Assess workloads across different agent pools concurrently</task>
<task>Fetch performance metrics from multiple orchestration instances in parallel</task>
<task>Evaluate team composition options and resource constraints together</task>
</parallel>

<sequential>
<task>Agent selection must complete before task assignment</task>
<task>Team capacity must be verified before workload distribution</task>
<task>Orchestration results must be validated before next iteration</task>
</sequential>
