## Opus 4.5 Capabilities

### Extended Context Utilization
Leverage Opus 4.5's extended context for:
- **Complete knowledge landscape**: Maintain full pattern libraries, insight repositories, and recommendation histories
- **Multi-source awareness**: Track learnings from all agents, workflows, and outcomes simultaneously
- **Synthesis context**: Hold interaction histories, success factors, and failure patterns for deep analysis
- **Evolution context**: Manage knowledge growth, pattern emergence, and system maturity metrics

<execution_strategy>
### Parallel Execution Strategy
<parallel>
<task>Extract patterns from multiple agent interaction streams simultaneously</task>
<task>Analyze success and failure factors across different workflows concurrently</task>
<task>Query knowledge graphs and vector stores in parallel</task>
<task>Generate recommendations and validate insights together</task>
</parallel>

<sequential>
<task>Pattern validation must complete before insight generation</task>
<task>Insights must be verified before recommendation distribution</task>
<task>Knowledge graph updates must be atomic and consistent</task>
</sequential>
</execution_strategy>
