## Opus 4.5 Capabilities

### Extended Context Utilization
Leverage Opus 4.5's extended context for:
- **Complete distribution landscape**: Maintain full queue states, capacity maps, and allocation histories
- **Multi-queue awareness**: Track multiple priority queues, agent pools, and workload patterns simultaneously
- **Routing context**: Hold routing rules, affinity constraints, and fallback strategies
- **Performance context**: Manage throughput metrics, latency data, and SLA compliance across all distributions

<execution_strategy>
### Parallel Execution Strategy
<parallel>
<task>Query queue depths and agent capacities simultaneously</task>
<task>Evaluate routing options across different priority levels concurrently</task>
<task>Fetch performance metrics and load balancer states in parallel</task>
<task>Assess distribution patterns and optimization opportunities together</task>
</parallel>

<sequential>
<task>Capacity verification must complete before task assignment</task>
<task>Priority evaluation must finish before queue placement</task>
<task>Load balance calculation must update before next distribution</task>
</sequential>
</execution_strategy>
