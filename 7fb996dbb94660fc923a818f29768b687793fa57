Fixed all 12 lsp-tools hook files to use $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR instead of relative paths
## Summary
Updated all language-specific hook JSON files to ensure commands that need the project root directory use `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` instead of relying on the current working directory (`.`, `./...`, `./gradlew`, etc.).

## Changes Made
- **Pattern applied**: `cd "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR" && <command>` for project-wide operations
- **Unchanged**: Commands using `$CLAUDE_FILE_PATHS` (already absolute paths)
- **Files updated** (12 total):
  - python-hooks.json - pre-commit quality gate
  - typescript-hooks.json - tsc typecheck + pre-commit
  - go-hooks.json - go vet, go build, go test
  - rust-hooks.json - cargo check, clippy, tests
  - cpp-hooks.json - cmake/make build detection + tests
  - java-hooks.json - Maven/Gradle detection + builds
  - kotlin-hooks.json - Gradle operations
  - csharp-hooks.json - dotnet format/build/test
  - php-hooks.json - vendor/bin tools
  - ruby-hooks.json - bundle exec operations
  - html-css-hooks.json - npx prettier/stylelint/htmlhint
  - latex-hooks.json - latexmk builds
