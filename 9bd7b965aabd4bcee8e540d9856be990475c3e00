MCP tools in agent frontmatter may be conditionally available, not fictional
## Context
During the agent review, I incorrectly flagged tools like `magic`, `context7`, `agent-registry`, etc. as "fictional" because they weren't in the core Claude Code toolset. However, MCP tools can be dynamically enabled/disabled based on context management needs.

## Clarification
The tools field in agent frontmatter can reference:
1. **Core MCP tools** - Always available (Read, Write, Bash, Glob, Grep)
2. **Plugin-provided MCP tools** - Available when their MCP server is enabled
3. **CLI tools** - Require Bash execution (go, docker, kubectl, etc.)

Tools like `magic`, `context7`, `playwright` may be legitimate MCP servers that are:
- Enabled only when specific plugins are active
- Loaded on-demand to manage context window usage
- Environment-specific (dev vs prod)

## Impact on Report
The "Placeholder/Fictional Tools" critical finding should be reclassified. The real issue is **documentation** - agents should indicate whether tools are:
- Always available
- Conditionally available (which plugin/condition enables them)
- CLI tools accessed via Bash

MCP tools in agent frontmatter may be conditionally available, not fictional
## Context
During the agent review, I incorrectly flagged tools like `magic`, `context7`, `agent-registry`, etc. as "fictional" because they weren't in the core Claude Code toolset. However, MCP tools can be dynamically enabled/disabled based on context management needs.

## Clarification
The tools field in agent frontmatter can reference:
1. **Core MCP tools** - Always available (Read, Write, Bash, Glob, Grep)
2. **Plugin-provided MCP tools** - Available when their MCP server is enabled
3. **CLI tools** - Require Bash execution (go, docker, kubectl, etc.)

Tools like `magic`, `context7`, `playwright` may be legitimate MCP servers that are:
- Enabled only when specific plugins are active
- Loaded on-demand to manage context window usage
- Environment-specific (dev vs prod)

## Impact on Report
The "Placeholder/Fictional Tools" critical finding should be reclassified. The real issue is **documentation** - agents should indicate whether tools are:
- Always available
- Conditionally available (which plugin/condition enables them)
- CLI tools accessed via Bash
