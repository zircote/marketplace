Enhance existing lsp-enable skill with strong enforcement and setup guidance
## Context
User chose to enhance the existing lsp-enable directory rather than create a new skill, with strong enforcement patterns (similar to systematic-debugging) and setup/verification guidance.

## Rationale
- Existing directory already contains comprehensive reference files for 12+ languages
- Strong enforcement ensures LSP is treated as mandatory for semantic code operations
- Setup guidance ensures users verify ENABLE_LSP_TOOL=1 and LSP server availability
- Follows proven patterns from debugging skills (iron laws, decision trees, red flags)

- plugins/zircote/skills/debugging/systematic-debugging/SKILL.md (pattern reference)

Implementing LSP enforcement skill with all three iron laws and comprehensive triggers
## Context
User confirmed: all trigger phrases, all three enforcement scenarios as iron laws, warn-and-fix fallback strategy, and lean SKILL.md with references.

## Rationale
- Strong enforcement matches proven patterns from systematic-debugging skill
- Comprehensive triggers ensure skill activates on all LSP-relevant scenarios
- Warn-and-fix fallback provides guidance without blocking
- Reference-based structure keeps SKILL.md lean while leveraging existing language files

XML demarcation improvements validated by Anthropic official documentation
## Context
Comprehensive research conducted on XML tag best practices from official Anthropic sources, followed by systematic audit of 489 files across marketplace plugins.

## Rationale
- Anthropic explicitly states XML tags are "game-changers" for structured prompts
- Claude was "trained specifically to recognize XML tags as a prompt organizing mechanism"
- No "magic" tags exist - semantic names that describe content are recommended
- Current marketplace adoption is inconsistent (0-100% depending on component)
