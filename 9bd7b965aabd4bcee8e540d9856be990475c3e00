## Changes Made

### 1. deep-explore.md (49 LSP mentions)
- Added LSP to allowed-tools
- Added `<lsp_integration>` section with availability check and decision matrix
- Updated Phase 2 to include LSP-based symbol discovery
- Added 5th parallel subagent for call graph analysis using LSP
- Updated output structure to track LSP methodology
- Added LSP decision tree in execution instruction

### 2. deep-research.md (25 LSP mentions)
- Added LSP to allowed-tools
- Updated `<codebase_research>` section with LSP-first approach
- Added LSP operations for architecture discovery and pattern analysis
- Updated output structure to track LSP availability
- Added LSP decision tree in execution instruction

### 3. cr.md (35 LSP mentions)
- Added LSP to allowed-tools
- Added `<lsp_integration>` section with decision matrix
- Updated all 6 specialist subagents with LSP guidance
- Updated execution sequence with LSP availability check
- Updated report metadata to include LSP methodology

### 4. cr-fx.md (31 LSP mentions)
- Added LSP to allowed-tools
- Added `<lsp_integration>` section with remediation protocol
- Updated 4 remediation agents with LSP guidance
- Updated execution sequence with Step 0.5 LSP check
- Updated remediation report to track LSP usage

Completed full remediation of 116 zircote agents
## Context
Addressed critical findings from agent review, implementing all recommended fixes across the agent collection.

## Completed Fixes
1. **LSP Integration** - Added to all 23 language specialists
2. **Section Renaming** - "MCP Tool Suite" → "CLI Tools (via Bash)" across 110+ files
3. **Core Tools** - All 116 agents now have Read, Write, Bash, Glob, Grep
4. **Report Updates** - Reclassified findings, added remediation summary

## Files Modified
- 23 language specialists (added LSP)
- 6 research-analysis agents (added Bash, Glob, Grep)
- 6 business-product agents (added core tools)
- 4 quality-security agents (added Glob, Grep)
- 3 meta-orchestration agents (added Bash, Glob, Grep)
- 7 agents with MultiEdit (added Glob, Grep)
- AGENT_REVIEW_REPORT.md (updated metrics and added remediation summary)

Updated 4 commands to integrate LSP tools when available
## Context
The lsp-tools plugin provides semantic code intelligence via LSP operations (goToDefinition, findReferences, hover, documentSymbol, workspaceSymbol, incomingCalls, outgoingCalls). These commands were not leveraging LSP when available.

## Changes Made

### 1. deep-explore.md (49 LSP mentions)
- Added LSP to allowed-tools
- Added `<lsp_integration>` section with availability check and decision matrix
- Updated Phase 2 to include LSP-based symbol discovery
- Added 5th parallel subagent for call graph analysis using LSP
- Updated output structure to track LSP methodology
- Added LSP decision tree in execution instruction

### 2. deep-research.md (25 LSP mentions)
- Added LSP to allowed-tools
- Updated `<codebase_research>` section with LSP-first approach
- Added LSP operations for architecture discovery and pattern analysis
- Updated output structure to track LSP availability
- Added LSP decision tree in execution instruction

### 3. cr.md (35 LSP mentions)
- Added LSP to allowed-tools
- Added `<lsp_integration>` section with decision matrix
- Updated all 6 specialist subagents with LSP guidance
- Updated execution sequence with LSP availability check
- Updated report metadata to include LSP methodology

### 4. cr-fx.md (31 LSP mentions)
- Added LSP to allowed-tools
- Added `<lsp_integration>` section with remediation protocol
- Updated 4 remediation agents with LSP guidance
- Updated execution sequence with Step 0.5 LSP check
- Updated remediation report to track LSP usage

Added code-cleanup.md to LSP integration update
## Context
The code-cleanup.md command was missing from the original update. It's a comprehensive two-step command that combines code review (Step 1) and remediation (Step 2).

## Changes Made to code-cleanup.md (52 LSP mentions)
- Added LSP to allowed-tools in frontmatter
- Added LSP-First Navigation principle to Core Principles
- Added `<lsp_integration>` section with availability check and decision matrix
- Updated all 6 Step 1 review subagents with LSP guidance
- Updated all 4 Step 2 remediation agents with LSP guidance
- Added LSP availability check to Step 1 execution (Step 0)
- Added LSP availability check to Step 2 execution (Step 0.5)
- Updated CODE_REVIEW.md report metadata to track LSP
- Updated REMEDIATION_REPORT.md to track LSP methodology
