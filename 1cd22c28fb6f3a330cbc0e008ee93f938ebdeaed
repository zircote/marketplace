Enhance existing lsp-enable skill with strong enforcement and setup guidance
## Context
User chose to enhance the existing lsp-enable directory rather than create a new skill, with strong enforcement patterns (similar to systematic-debugging) and setup/verification guidance.

## Rationale
- Existing directory already contains comprehensive reference files for 12+ languages
- Strong enforcement ensures LSP is treated as mandatory for semantic code operations
- Setup guidance ensures users verify ENABLE_LSP_TOOL=1 and LSP server availability
- Follows proven patterns from debugging skills (iron laws, decision trees, red flags)
