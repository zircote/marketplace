Agents structured for MCP tools vs CLI tools
## Pattern
Frontmatter `tools:` should only list actual MCP integrations. CLI tools should be documented in body text with "accessed via Bash" clarification.

## Evidence
All 116 agents mix MCP tools (Read, Write, Glob) with CLI tools (docker, kubectl, go) in the same `tools:` field, creating ambiguity about what's integrated vs what requires shell execution.
