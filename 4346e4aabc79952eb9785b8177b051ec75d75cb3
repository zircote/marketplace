XML demarcation improvements validated by Anthropic official documentation
## Context
Comprehensive research conducted on XML tag best practices from official Anthropic sources, followed by systematic audit of 489 files across marketplace plugins.

## Rationale
- Anthropic explicitly states XML tags are "game-changers" for structured prompts
- Claude was "trained specifically to recognize XML tags as a prompt organizing mechanism"
- No "magic" tags exist - semantic names that describe content are recommended
- Current marketplace adoption is inconsistent (0-100% depending on component)
